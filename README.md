# Automatic-car-parking-system
## 🤳 Introduction
In most big cities, there is a growing issue with the number of vehicles on the streets and the lack of parking space. Hence, in order to assist drivers in finding a suitable parking place quickly, the demand for automatic car parking systems is rising. The device developed in this project will help the driver in finding the space to park the vehicle and also inform if there are any objects near by so that the car could be parked in the parking space efficiently. In future, we can add more Internet of things (IoT) related aspects to this project such as it can be controlled by other devices and apps for finding the parking and making the car easier to park.

## 👩🏻‍💻Audience
This project will be helful to the drivers in parking their car at the right location and make a decision on where to park the car as this project detects the object in the close proximity and alarms the driver about it.

## 🛠️ How to build the project 
We build the Arduino based automatic car parking system by using the Arduino kit and different components such as ultrasonic sensors, resistors, wires. This
project leads to creation of a kind of smart car parking system that will inform the car drivers about the availability of the car parking slots in the parking area and allow them to efficiently park the car avoiding any obstacles and vehicles on the way. The car driver will be informed about the presence of any device or obstacle near by during the car parking. This project has a very real, cost effective and efficient parking solution in the real world.
