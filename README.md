# Automatic-car-parking-system
## Introduction
In most big cities, there is a growing issue with the number of vehicles on the streets and the lack of parking space. Hence, in order to assist drivers in finding a suitable parking place quickly, the demand for automatic car parking systems is rising. The device developed in this project will help the driver in finding the space to park the vehicle and also inform if there are any objects near by so that the car could be parked in the parking space efficiently. In future, we can add more Internet of things (IoT) related aspects to this project such as it can be controlled by other devices and apps for finding the parking and making the car easier to park.
